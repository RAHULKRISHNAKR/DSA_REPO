## About the Repository

This repository serves as a learning resource for mastering data structures and algorithms. It includes various algorithmic problems, their solutions, and explanations. Each topic is well-structured with examples and test cases to help users understand the working of algorithms.

The repository is organized topic-wise, with each folder dedicated to a specific data structure or algorithm category. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, participating in coding competitions, or just improving your problem-solving skills, this repo can be a useful companion.

## Languages Used
- **C++**
- **Python**
- **Java**
- **Other languages (as needed)**

The implementations are primarily done in C++ and Python, but contributions in other languages are welcome.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is divided into the following folders:
- **Arrays:** Implementation of various problems on arrays like searching, sorting, and optimization problems.
- **Linked Lists:** Problems related to singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues:** Solutions for problems using stacks and queues.
- **Trees:** Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and problems related to tree traversals.
- **Graphs:** Graph traversal algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and other graph-related problems.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Popular DP problems along with their solutions.
- **Greedy Algorithms:** Classic greedy approach problems with explanations.
- **Sorting and Searching:** Implementations of common sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort, etc.) and searching techniques.
- **Miscellaneous:** Other algorithmic problems like bit manipulation, backtracking, etc.

Each folder contains:
1. **Problem statement**
2. **Solution file(s)**
3. **Test cases**

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
